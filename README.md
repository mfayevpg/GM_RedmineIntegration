GM_RedmineIntegration
=====================

A GreaseMonkey Script to help with Redmine issue management and github pull request

Pre-Requisites
---------------------

+ GreaseMonkey Firefox extension. (https://addons.mozilla.org/fr/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/)
+ Must have activated your API access to Redmine (in account setup)

+ Install this script using Greasemonkey

### First start

When you're starting the script for the first time it will ask you 3 things :
1. A crypto key (give whatever you like, it will be use to crypt your login information in Firefox)
2. Your API redmine key that you can find in your account configuration on Redmine
3. The Redmine access URL

Once everything is done, you just have to go on a pull request page on github and it will fetch needed information :)
